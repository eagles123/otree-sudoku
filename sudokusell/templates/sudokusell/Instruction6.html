            Remember, your earnings do not depend on how many puzzles you solve correctly or whether you choose instead to visit other websites.  
            At the end, the screen will inform you privately about the number of puzzles you finished correctly and the minutes you spent working on them. 
            This information will not be known to anyone in the room, including the experimenter.  (It will be used later for statistical purposes).
