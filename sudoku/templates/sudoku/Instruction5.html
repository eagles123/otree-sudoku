            <p>During the 30 minutes, you are welcome to either solve the puzzles or, at any time, choose instead to visit other websites. 
            But you have to make a choice to visit other websites. 
            In every page, there is this reminder: “please do not visit other websites while playing the game, unless you choose to do so by clicking the button at the bottom.”</p>
            <p>If you chose to “visit other websites, you cannot return to the game, but it will not affect your earnings that you will be able to collect at the end of the experiment.</p>
            <p>As instructed at the start, during the 30 minutes, you can “leave the experiment altogether,” but then you earn nothing.</p>
